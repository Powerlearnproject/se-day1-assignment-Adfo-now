Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
It's importance in the technology industry is that it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Development of programming languages such as Fortran and C.
In 1960, software engineering was established as a discipline which would be studied.
In the 1970s, it was the period of advent of structured programming.
in the 2000s, there came rise in agile methodologies used till today.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements - is the gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design - involves creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface 
Implementation - is the writing of codes and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing - involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment - it is releasing software to the users.
Maintenance - it is providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Both are software development methodologies that guide the software development process.
Waterfall methodology - is a sequential approach with distinct phases (requirements, design, implementation)
flowing downwards like a waterfall.
Agile methodology - is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer is responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.

Project Manager - oversees planning, execution, and delivery of software projects 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environment is a software suite that provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing codes such as Visual studio code, Eclipse.
Version Control Systems are used to track changes to source code and coordinating work among team members such as Git, Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenges include; changing requirements during the development cycle.
Tight deadlines that puts pressure and compromises quality.
Technical debt that impedes future development efforts and increased maintenance costs.
Strategies for overcoming challenges;
effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing is the testing of individual components of software.
Integration testing is the testing of interactions between different components or subsystems.
System testing is the testing of the entire system, as a whole.
Acceptance testing is the testing of software against user requirements.
These help in ensuring that software products meet specified quality standards and functional requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs. It helps in improving user requirements experience, it increases flexibility and allows the developer to have more control over it.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 
Vague prompt
Draw a house in the plains.

Improved prompt.
Draw a bungalow house in the plains, it has a flower garden of blue and pink flowers the balcony is spacious. The house is grey from the outside.

The improved prompt is more effective because it has clear, specific and concise instructions that makes it easier for the artist what is needed by the user.
